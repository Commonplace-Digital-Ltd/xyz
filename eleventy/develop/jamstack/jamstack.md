# JAMStack

XYZ application views maybe accessed through the XYZ View API or through the markup and script from a CDN. It is recommended to use the XYZ Library to connect to the XYZ API. Restful calls however may also be sent directly to the API.

Views may be accessed on their own or can be embedded into other applications.
